## Prototype of Pokémon Pokedex
# This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic Pokémon Pokedex. Users can load additional Pokémon as needed, check Pokémon details, and toggle their "Caught" state.

## Qualities
# Pokémon cards with names and photographs are displayed on the interactive Pokémon grid.
# To view a Pokémon card's name, image, height, weight, type, and "Caught" status, click on it.
# Add More Pokémon: Add ten more Pokémon at once.
# The design adapts to various screen sizes when it is responsive.

## Technology 
# HTML was used for structuring.
# CSS: For layout and style.
# Toggling the "Caught" state and loading Pokémon are examples of dynamic interactions that use JavaScript.

## Actions Done
# constructed the rudimentary HTML structure and applied CSS styling.
# JavaScript was used to display Pokémon in a grid and provide comprehensive information when a click was made.
# To display additional Pokémon and toggle their "Caught" status, the "Load More" button was added.
# Difficulties in Managing Dynamic Data: Making certain that Pokémon data was appropriately loaded and presented.
# Making sure the layout functions properly on desktop and mobile devices is known as responsive design.
# Event Handling: Verifying that the right Pokémon was clicked and that the "Caught" state was toggled.

## In conclusion
# A functional, interactive online application displaying Pokémon data is the Pokémon Pokedex prototype. With its emphasis on responsive design and interactivity, the project improved my front-end development abilities.
